# Anomaly Detection 
This project is a comparison of unsupervised machine learning techniques in anomaly detection in a time series using the MC2 2018 data set.

## FB Prophet
Detect anomalies in a time series using FB Prophet. The data set used here is the data set provided by the VAST Challenge MC2 2018. 

## Clustering(DBSCAN and Isolation Forest)
Detect anomalies using DBSCAN and Isolation Forest. Both clustering methods group similar data points together and detect the points that do not fall within those categories.
